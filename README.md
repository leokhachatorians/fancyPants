# fancyPants
## What is fancyPants?
* A simple, multi-threaded, selenium backed, Instagram photo saving GUI (soon) thing.
* Bypasses the pesky Instagram API to seamlessly (kinda) download, in bulk, all the photos of a specified user (given that their account is public)

## To do
* Make it a GUI with command lind options to run in the console
* Allow login via selenium (?), too grab private account photos

## Problems
* Really only works well with a Firefox webbrowser driver
* Everything else
